                            <p>In a world filled with anxiety, adversity, and overwhelming pressure, it’s easy to feel
                                like giving up. But what if the pain you’ve walked through was never meant to break you,
                                but to build the strength to carry others?

                                Hosted by Kayla Skinner - a devoted wife, loving mother of three, and woman of Apostolic
                                faith—this podcast speaks life to the weary soul. Through heartfelt testimony, biblical
                                truth, and faith-affirming scientific insights, Kayla offers a voice of hope to women
                                navigating life’s valleys. She knows the struggle because she’s lived it. And she knows
                                the victory because God brought her through it.

                                Join her each week for uplifting conversations, transparent stories, and empowering
                                encouragement that remind us: there is strength for the journey, grace for the climb,
                                and joy in the carrying.

                                Because sometimes, just hearing “You’re not alone” is the strength someone needs to
                                carry through.</p>
